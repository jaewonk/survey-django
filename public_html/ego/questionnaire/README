About Seantis Questionnaire
===========================

Seantis Questionnaire is a django questionnaire app which is easily customised
and includes advanced dependency support using boolean expressions.

It allows an administrator to create and edit questionnaires in the django
admin interface, with support for multiple languages.

It was originally created to support an annually recurring questionnnaire for a
medical study.

This repository only contains the Questionnaire side of the application.  We
also developed a management interface and extensions to the models that are
specific to the study, and have therefore not been made public.  Seantis GmbH
could, however, provide a similar end-to-end solution for your organisation.


Alternatives
============

There are two other questionnaire-type applications that I stumbled upon, but
they both didn't quite scratch my itch, but they may scratch yours.

Django Questionnaire - http://djangoquest.aperte-it.com/

Django Survey - http://code.google.com/p/django-survey/


Requirements
============

Seantis Questionnaire has some external dependencies that you must
install.

django-transmeta - used for simple internationalisation
